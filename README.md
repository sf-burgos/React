# Web sockets in React

    - full-duplex (or two-way)
    - TCP
    - Client and Server
    - Using Ports 80 and 443

### Why you should  use Web sockets?

    - Are designed to supersede the existing bidirectional communication technologies
    - Full duplex in REAL TIME 
    - Are similar to SSe but use taking messages back from the client to the server
